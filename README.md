# A revival of my old RosBE-PPC (WIP)

This is currently WIP and not fully working.

The result of running install.sh is (hopefully) a collection of installed
software that, when put in use by sourcing $PREFIX/rosbe in your terminal.

It will override make and powerpcle-unknown-elf-gcc in order to allow you
to build windows binaries for powerpc.

install.sh does most of the work, see that for details at the moment.
